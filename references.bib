	abstract="Commercial off-the-shelf programmable platforms for real-time systems typically contain a cache to bridge the gap between the processor speed and main memory speed. Because cache-related pre-emption delays (CRPD) can have a significant influence on the computation times of tasks, CRPD have been integrated in the response time analysis for fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling (FPPS). This paper presents CRPD aware response-time analysis of sporadic tasks with arbitrary deadlines for fixed-priority pre-emption threshold scheduling (FPTS), generalizing earlier work. The analysis is complemented by an optimal (pre-emption) threshold assignment algorithm, assuming the priorities of tasks are given. We further improve upon these results by presenting an algorithm that searches for a layout of tasks in memory that makes a task set schedulable. The paper includes an extensive comparative evaluation of the schedulability ratios of FPPS and FPTS, taking CRPD into account. The practical relevance of our work stems from FPTS support in AUTOSAR, a standardized development model for the automotive industry. [(This paper forms an extended version of Bril et al.

Motivated by the apparent gap between computer science and automatic control theory, a set of requirements for real-time implementation of control applications is given. A real-time behavioral model for control applications is then presented and exemplified. Important sources and characteristics of time-variations in distributed computer systems are investigated. This illuminates key execution strategies to ensure the required timing behavior. Implications on design and implementation and directions for further work are discussed.",

This seminal research has been cited in over 200 subsequent papers and transferred to industry in the form of commercial CAN schedulability analysis tools. These tools have been used by a large number of major automotive manufacturers in the design of in-vehicle networks for a wide range of cars, millions of which have been manufactured during the last decade.",
